# The Coders Computer

## Choosing A Text Editor

- All text editors are different in that they provide different types of functions, extensions, style, and feel.
- Use a text editor that gets the job done and that you enjoy using!
- Top features to look for in a text editor
  1. code completion 
  2. syntax highlighting 
  3. a nice variety of themes 
  4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

## The Command Line

- the command line will typically present a promt which will be displayed before your typed commands
- pwd - **Print Working directory** prints the current working directory
- ls - **List** Shows what is inside the current directory
- l - **Long Listing** Prints out the following of the listed documents
  1. First character indicates whether it is a normal file ( - ) or directory ( d )
  2. Next 9 characters are permissions for the file or directory (we'll learn more about them in section 6).
  3. The next field is the number of blocks (don't worry too much about this).
  4. The next field is the owner of the file or directory (ryan in this case).
  5. The next field is the group the file or directory belongs to (users in this case).
  6. Following this is the file size.
  7. Next up is the file modification time.
  8. Finally we have the actual name of the file or directory.
- cd - **change directoy** changes to the location specified following the command

### Paths

There are two types of paths

- **Absolute** will provide the same output regardless of current location
- **Relative** will have different outcomes depending on the current location
- The very top of the hierarchical structures is the root directory denoted by a (/)
- the tilde ~ key is short for the home directory
- the dot . key references the current directory
- double dot .. references the parent directory

## Files!

- Linux is case sensitive so always double check you are issuing the correct casing when typing
- Linux is an extensionless system and does not need extensions like .jpg or .txt
- Be careful with spacing as it can affect typing out commands
- Using quotes '' encases everything to one item 
- Backslash (\) nullifies the special meaning of the next character
- files starting with a dot (.) are hidden files
- to see hidden files include use **ls -a**
