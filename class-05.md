  - `alt` is a text description for accessability issues
  - `title` provides more information for the image
  - `height` to control the images height
  - `width` to control the images width
- Be sure to save the image in the correct format, at the right size, and account for the resolution change of different users
- **JPEG** should be used for images with lots of different colors
- **PNG** should be used for images that are a majority flat color
- Measurements for adjusting size of images should always be done so in reference to pixels
- Vector Images are not affected by resolution and can scale as you adjust their size
