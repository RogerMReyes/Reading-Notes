# Learning Markdown

## Headings

- To dictate levels of headings use the # character
- More # increases the level of the heading
- Always leave a space after the # and leave a space before and after the heading text

## Emphasis

- In order to emphasize certain text it should be **Bold** or *Italicized* or ***Both***

## Ordered and UnOrdered Lists

- For **Ordered** lists start with 1 followed by a period
- The numbers following do not have to be in numerical order
- For **Unordered** lists you can use (-), (*), or (+).
- Indenting again will create nested lists

## Images

- Start the line with (!) for an image
- Brackets [] will determine the alt text
- Parentheses () will contain the link to the image 

## Backticks

- Backticks denotes a word or phrase as code
- if the line contains backticks you can enclose it in double backticks 

## Links

- Enclose the link text in brackets[]
- immediately after it will be followed by parentheses to the URL
- To turn URL's or email addresses into links quickly enclose them in angle brackets <>
- Formatting with * also works with links
- To link inside text it is best to encapsulate the text in [] and reference it with a [label] with the link later in the text
