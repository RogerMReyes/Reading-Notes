## Cascading Styel Sheets

CSS allows you to style and structure your web pages  

### CSS Syntax

- CSS is a rule based language  
- You can specify what groups have to follow what kind of rules that you specify  

The following example will specify what color and size the heading font will be  
h1 {  
color: red;  
font-size: 5em;  
}  

- Color can be input in several ways such as
  - HEX values
  - RGB/RGBA values
  - HSL/HSLA values

## Adding CSS

There are Three ways of inserting CSS

- **External CSS** - Links an external file containing all the rules that you want applied
- **Internal CSS** - Is added directly on the page in order to apply to everything on the page
- **Inline CSS** - Adds the rules in line into the attribution of the element to only affect the line it's inserted into

The last used style sheet will always be the style that will be applied
