## Summary

Java runs on a two type system with the first being primitive and the second being object reference or wrapper classes. When it comes to primitives as a single item the memory space they take up is significantly smaller that reference types. However, it must also be noted that when primitives are in array they end up either equal or take up more memory space. Wrapper classes also nearly double the processing time of primitive type in most cases. Wrapper classes will more often be used when dealing with collections or reflection API. 

Exceptions are used to handle a disruption when executing a program. Try catch blocks can be used to perform blocks of code inside the try block and execute the catch block if the conditional to the exception comes up. Code located inside a final block of code will always run regardless if an exception was caught or not. From the Oracle Java documentation when deciding to manually code an exception, "If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception." (Oracle, 2022). 

Scanners take in an input and breaks it down to utilize the information inside as tokens. This is very useful in actions such as taking in a users input or going through a given file and iterating over the information. 

## Things I want to know more About

I would like to learn more about BigO timing. When it came to learning JavaScript the required processing time for certain actions was rarely talked about. From the information I have gathered so far it looks like noting BigO timing and how efficient our code is will start to play a bigger factor in future coding.
