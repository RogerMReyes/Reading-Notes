## Summary

When it comes to testing spring we will be using MockMvc as it proveds support for all the testing capabilities. MockMvc will encapsulate all of the web app beans and make them available for testing. A simple test would be to use .perform() in order to call a GET request method and the result can be printed out with .andDo(print()). Get requests can also be fitted with Path variables and Query Parameters to expand the range of testing possible. Other useful methods for testing include .status which returns a status code and .isOK() which checks for a status code of 200.

## Things I want to know more About

I would like to know more about how a big company sets up their testing suits and how they look/ how they are organized.
