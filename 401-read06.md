## Summary

Interfaces are like a set standard made by the creator of the software that defines how others can implement their own code to interact with theirs. An example would be an automobile company making methods that allow a care to turn on and off the right and left blinker. These methods are then available for outside programmers to set up other methods that interact with them. This is denoted by having `implements` following the class name and following the class its implementing.  
Inheritance can be seen as Java's class hierarchy. Classes that `extend` other classes inherit all the fields and methods of its parent class unless they are set to private. Children can also be cast as its parents type and can be used in place of its parent. The inverse however does not compile as its parent cannot be cast as its child.

## Things I want to know more About

I want to learn more about the possibilities of inheritance and am interested in seeing what an inheritance tree looks like in a professional setting for a large company.
