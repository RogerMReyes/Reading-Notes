## Summary

When it comes to handling HTTP requests in Spring MVC a @Controller is used. Thymeleaf is used to perform server-side rendering of the HTML. Spring Initializr creates the application for the user and the main method will use SpringApplication.run() method to launch the app. The app can also be run on the command line with Gradle or Maven. For gradle the command would be `./gradlew bootRun` to run the application and `./gradlew build` to build the JAR file. The index.html will serve as the root page and will be seen at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Things I want to know more About

I would like to learn more about getting SpringMVC applications up and running and how to set up the structure. The reading went over creating a simple Hello World application but there is still a lot more about SpringMVC that I would like to know more about.
