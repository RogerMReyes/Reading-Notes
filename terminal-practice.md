# Terminal Practice

## The Command Line

The command line, also known as the terminal, is a text based interface to the system. A user is able to input commands and will receive feedback through text. For a Windows user to open a terminal they can either use PowerShell or for remote access Putty.

## Basic Navigation

`pwd` - print working directory  
`ls` - list contents of current directory  
`cd` - change directories  

## Paths

can be absolute (contains complete directory from root) or relative (points to directory from current position)

## More About Files

Everything is a file and a path is a means to get to a particular location which is the file. When naming files it is important to take into account case sensitivity and spaces.

## Manual Pages

man can be used to look at what certain Linux commands do and even allow us to do a search for key terms if we are unsure of the command name but know what action we want out of it.

## File Manipulation

- mkdir - makes a new directory
- rmdir - removes a directory
- touch - creates a new file
- cp - copies a file or directory
- mv - moves a file or directory from one location to another
- rm - deletes a file
