# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## Duckett HTML

### HTML Chapter 1 Structure

- The use of headings and sub-headings will help show a hierarchy of info
- HTLM uses elements enclosed in tags to make up a web page
- Tags are containers and will tell you about the elements contained inside
- Attributes within the tag can provide additional information of the elements inside
- Attribute names should always be lowercase
- To view how other websites are structured you can **View Source** to see the HTML behind it

### Html Chapter 8 Extra Markup

- **DOCTYPE** is always declared at the start to signify the version of HTML being used
- Comments can be made by inserting like so <\!-- comment goes here -->
- **ID** attributes give a unique identifier that can be further used to target and alter that ID specifically
- To group several elements together a **class** attribute can be used instead
- The **div** tag can be used to group several elements to help structure the page
- **span** is the inline equivalent of **div**
- An **iframe** is a window cut into your page to display another page
- **mete** is typically inside the head and is used to contain information to help search engines or set an expiration for the page
- Characters that are reserved for HTML us can instead be input with **Escape Characters**

### HTML Chapter 17 HTML5 Layout

- Prior to HTML 5 elements were grouped in div tags with ID's assigned to them in order to organize a page
- HTML5 introduced layout elements to remove the need for the traditional div method
- Layout Elements
  - \<header> and \<footer> - will block the top and bottom of the page respectively
  - \<nav> - used to group major navigational blocks
  - \<article> - to contain parts of a page that can be standalone
  - \<aside> - inside an article tag it contains information related to the article and outside it is for container for content related to the entire page
  - \<sections> - groups relatable content together
  - \<hgroup> - used to group headers
  - \<figure> - contains contents to aid the article
- The div tag is still used when elements do not fall into the previous categories

### HTML Chapter 18: Process & Design

- Understand your target audience in order to appropriately design your page for better success
- Identify why people are coming to your site and expand on that to make adjustments
- Aim to fullfil what the people want
- Use a **site map** to get a bare layout of how you want everything to be grouped
- A **wireframe** can be used to see a basic outline of how you want your content to be shown on the page
- Grouping and Visual Aid will help guide the readers to the information they want

## Ducket JS

### JS Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming

- A script will walk a computer step by step in order to complete a goal
- The main goal should be defined first and then broken down into sections to complete
- Computers will follow the steps you give it to a T so you must think of all possible steps to lead it to where it needs to go
- Things can be classified as **Objects** and these objects can be defined with a certain set of properties the computer wil use to recognize what they are
- **Events** will be used to trigger certain functionalities of the script
- **Methods** contains instructions to interact with an object
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the main languages when creating web pages
  - HTML is the content layer
  - CSS is the presentation layer
  - JavaScript is the behavior layer
