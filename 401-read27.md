## Summary

### Tasks and Back Stack

- A task is a collection of activities the user interacts with
- When a new activity is started it is added to the back stack
- When the user goes back to the previous activity the top most activity is popped off the stack
- Back gesture at the root will default move the activity to the background
- In the background all activities and tasks are stopped but the backstack is maintained

### UI tests with Espresso

- Espresso lets you record your interactions and use asserts to verify UI elements

### Shared Preference

- A small collection of key-value pairs that can be saved and be used
- `getSharedPreferences()` - retrieves shared preference by name
- `getPreferences()` - is specific to the activity and doesn't have to be named
