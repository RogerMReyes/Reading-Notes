## Summary

Objects in java model real-world objects of real life. They contain properties and methods. An example could be a bike, properties of this bike would include 2 wheels, 1 chain, 1 horn. This bike could also have methods such as cycling peddle moves bike forward. A class is like a blueprint an object can be created from. Creating a bike class could hold the blueprint to create multiple different bike objects that contained the same types of properties and methods. When it comes to numbers there are multiple different systems that can be used. There is the base 10 that goes from 0-9 then starts again after adding 1 to the left ie 10. Binary is only represented in 0 and 1 but follow the same concept where once the base is reached the following number resets and the number to its left is increased by 1. Hexadecimal differs slightly in that they include the letters A-F after 9 but still follow the add 1 to the left on reset concept
