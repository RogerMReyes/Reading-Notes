## Summary

### Hashing

- clear text - the most unsecure way of password storage where it is stored "in the clear" and unencrypted
- plaintext - input of data to be put through a cryptographic algorithm
- plain text - the unformatted content in a text file
- hashing - running a mathematical algorithm that maps data into a bit string of a fixed size
Hashing is one way which makes it more secure as when it is stored there is no way to reverse the hash in order to get the original input. 

## Things I want to know more About

I would like to know more about common practices in the industry when it comes to password software.
