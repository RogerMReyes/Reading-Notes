# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## Chapter 3: Object Literals

- Variables apart of an object are known as properties
- Functions within objects are known as methods
- A property consists of a key and its value
- `this.` is used to reference the properties of the current object it is in
- dot notations is used to access the properties of objects

## Chapter 5: Document Object Model

- The DOM is a tree made up of objects
- This model is how the page is structured
- `getElementById()` - selecting individual node by id
- `querySelector()` - use a CSS selector and return first match
- `getElementByClassName()` - selects all elements with that class attribute
- `getElementsByTagName()` - selects all with the specified tag
- `querySelectorAll()` - selects all CSS with the specified selector
- When a DOM list returns more than one element, it returns as a **NodeList**
- Elements in this NodeList can be accessed similar to an array with indexes
- NodeList are known as an object called a collection
- `parentNode` selects the parent node to the node currently in
- `previousSibling` and `nextSibling` return the previous or next node
- `firstChild` and `lastChild` return the first or last node of the current element
