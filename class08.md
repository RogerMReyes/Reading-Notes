# CSS Layout

- `display` - used to make the box inline or block
- inline elements will sit side by side next to each other
- block elements will always start on a new line
- `flex` is most commonly used when designing boxes regulated to one axis
- `gird` is more designed to control multi-axis layouts
- when working with float, it may adjust the following elements so be sure to address it
- `column-count` will increase the amount of columns a list can have
- `column-gap` determines the gap between additional columns
- `relative` will adjust element position based on its current position in the document
- `absolute` will break the element out of the document flow and allow you to place it anywhere with the elements around it filling its missing space
