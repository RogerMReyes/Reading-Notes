# Programming with JavaScript Lab 07

## Control Flow

- Control flow is the order in which your computer executes statements in a script
- Scripts use condition structures such as
  - Loops
  - Function
  - Events

## JavaScript Function

- A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task
- It executes whe something invokes/calls it
- It is defined by a `function` keyword followed by ()
- Inside the parentheses may be parameters
- The code to be executed is placed inside curly brackets following the parentheses
- Function can be called three different ways
  - When an event occurs (user action)
  - When it is called in the code
  - When it is set to be self invoked
- Function `return` will return whatever value the code executes back to the statement
- You can define the code once and use it multiple times
- Variable declared within a function are **Local** Variables and can only be referenced within the function

## JavaScript Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

\+ Addition  
\- Subtraction  
\* Multiplication  
\** Exponentiation (ES2016)  
/ Division  
% Modulus (Division Remainder)  
\++ Increment  
\-- Decrement

### Assignment Operators

=     | x = y    | x = y  
\+=   | x += y | x = x + y  
\-=    | x -= y  | x = x - y  
\*=    | x \*= y    | x = x \* y  
/=    | x /= y   | x = x / y  
%=   | x %= y | x = x % y  
\**=    | x **= y | x = x ** y

### Comparison Operators

== equal to  
=== equal value and equal type  
!= not equal  
!== not equal value or not equal type  
\> greater than  
< less than  
\>= greater than or equal to  
<= less than or equal to  
? ternary operator

### Logical Operators

&& logical and  
|| logical or  
! logical not
