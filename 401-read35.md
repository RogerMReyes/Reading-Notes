## Summary

### Graphs

- non-linear datastructures
- nodes connected to other nodes by line segments referred to as edges
- Neighbor - adjacent nodes
- Degree - number of edges a vertex has
- **Undirect Graph** - each edge is indirect or bidirectional i.e. not specifically directed to another node
- **Directed Graph** - each edge is specifically directed to another node
- **Complete Graph** - All nodes are connected to all the other nodes
- **Connected Graph** - All vertexes/nodes have at least one edge
- **Disconnected Graph** - Some vertexes don't have an edge
- **Acyclic** - A node doesnt go through a cycle to end back at itself
- **Cyclic** - Node cycle can start and end on the same node

## Things I want to know more About

I would like to see a real life implementation of this datastructures
