## Summary

### Serverless Architecture

- event driven cloud based system where it relies on the third party services, client side logic, and cloud hosted Function as a Service
- Everything about the server is now managed by the cloud vendor
- Reduced Cost of operation due to being charged on number of executions instead of a constant running server
- Downside to this architecture is that it can only be accessed through private API's instead of an IP
- Dependencies must be packaged into the application itself
- Scaling it seamless but come with less control

### GraphQL

- Amplify creates DynamoDB tables for GraphQL using `@model`
- Amplify CLI generated TODO's to implement CRUD operations
- Also contains Relationships such as `@hasOne` and `@manyToMany`
