## Summary

HTTP requests can be made in Java by utilizing the in built class HttpUrlConnection or HttpClientAPI for the more recent JDK's. A connection object is created and has an attribute set to it such as GET, POST, or PUT etc. Parameters can then be added by setting doOutput to true and adding a String containing the paramters. Headers can also be set using setRequestProperty(). The response can be parsed and be built into a full response.
