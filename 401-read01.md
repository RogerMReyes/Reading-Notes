# Read 01

## Summary

This reading went into the basics of Java. Prior to this the class was focused on Javascript where a lot of the concepts are similar but differ greatly. Their is also a big difference in syntax and how everything is structured. A cheat sheet was also provided to help the transition to this new language. One key thing to remember is that Java is a strict language compared to JavaScript. This cuts out a lot of the Truthy/Falsy concepts and may be a lot easier for people to track. Variables are also always declared by their data type instead of using let or const which can be any datatype. Many concepts do carry over such as how looping works, how variables hold information, and how functions operate in a certain order are just a few. There are also concepts that are vary only slightly such as how their are arrays in both languages but in Java their sizes set and the information they hold must be declared.

## Things I want to know more About

Having taken classes of Java previously I have to refresh my knowledge on all the proper syntax for the language. One thing I would like to learn more about is how to implement the language in real life settings which I am looking forward to doing in upcoming projects.
