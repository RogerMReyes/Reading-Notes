## Summary

From todays reading the main concept that I got from it was to keep my code simple and short. When coding it good practice to stick to the rule of three where if you have to rewrite the same code more than three times then its a good time to look into refactoring it to make it more efficient. It is also important to not overextend yourself when coding. Its best to create an MVP to make sure everything works at its simplest form. From there you can go into introducing more intricate ideas.
