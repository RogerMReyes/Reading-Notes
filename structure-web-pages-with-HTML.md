# HTLM: Hyper Text Markup Language

Hypertext refers to links that conect web pages to one another.

## Anatomy of an HTML element

\<p>My cat is very grumpy\</p>

The entire line above is the **Element**  
\<p> at the front is the **Opening Tag** while \</p> is the **Closing Tag**
The text inbetween the tags is known as the **Content**

**Attributes** contain extra information about the element that you don't want appearing in the actual content 

Putting elements within other elements is referred to as nested elements  
EX. wrapping a word with \<strong> with bold the word

## Anatomy of an HTML document
 
- \<!DOCTYPE html> is a required preamble to ensure everything works how it should
- \<html></html> wraps all the content on the page 
- \<head></head> container for all the stuff you don't want shown to the page's viewers
- \<meta charset="utf-8"> sets the character set for the document
- \<title></title> sets the title of your page which shows on the browsers tab
- \<body></body> contains all the content you want shown to the page's viewers

### Marking Up Text

- \<h1>â€“\<h6> specifies the level of heading
- \<!-- and --> any text within the arrows is ignored and is an HTML comment
- \<p> contains paragraphs
- \<ul> are Unordered Lists
- \<ol> are Ordered Lists
- \<li> will wrap each item withiin a list

### Links

To add a link first wrap your text with an \<a> element  
You will then add an href attribute with the webaddress inside double quotes after href  
Ex. \<a \href="htttps/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>

## Sementaincs

**Semantics** refers to the meaning of a piece of code ie. what effect does running that line have?  
Ex. of Semantic tags

- \< articles >
- \< aside >
- \< details >
- \< figcaption >
- \< figure >
- \< footer >
- \< header >
- \< main >
- \< mark >
- \< nav >

## WireFrame Design

A wireframe is how the user/ client wants to process and place the information on a site  
Focus on meeting the clients needs or making the layout as smooth as possible  
Planning the design early will help smooth out the later processes  
Be sure to research the app or product in order to incorpate the data into the structure and vision of the end product  

Wireframes can either be done by hand on a piece of paper or by wireframe tools.  
Paper allows flexability and are easy to change on spot  
While wireframe tools have several extra features that may make the design process smoother
