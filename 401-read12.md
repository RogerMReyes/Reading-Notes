## Summary

When creating a Spring data JPA there are a few things to remember when building it out. `@Entity` indicates the JPA entity which are the objects you are storing. `@Id` is annotated where JPA will recognize the objects ID in the table. `@GeneratedValue` will generate this id automatically.   

### Spring Data Repositories

- **CrudRepository** - provides CRUD functions
- **PagingAndSortingRepository** - provides methods to do pagination and sort records
- **JpaRepository** - provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence and context and delete records in a batch
