## Summary

This reading went over imports and Loops. Java programming involves the use of pre-build classes in the language that can be accessed once imported at the top of the file. An example would be the class of ArrayList which is a java.util package. Once importing this class we are able to use ArrayLists and all of its available methods/properties. When it comes to loops in Java there are 4 main ways to construct them. The first is the standard for loop where the variable i is declared, a conditional is set, and the variable is incremented/decremented by a certain amount. The next method is a shortened version of the for loop which iterates over the argument given and a variable name is given for the values at the instance of iteration. The other two forms are while and do while loops, while loops will continue to loop as long as the condition followed after it remains true. For do while loops the first statement is conducted which is then followed by checking the conditional.

## Things I want to know more About

I would like to learn about the current trends in what types of loops are preferred. BigO timing becomes a big part in future programming in the efforts to reduce load on a computer system. Are their time differences when iterating over a standard loop and using the shortened for of loop?
